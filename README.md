# Process

I decided to create a Rails app. I used the Devise gem for simple user authentication. I ran into a couple of issues understanding all of the files Devise creates, but luckily their documentation is very thorough so I was quickly able to sort it out. I also used bootstrap-sass gem for responsiveness. I began by creating post functionality. I then worked on styling, and finished by implementing authentication. Overall the process was relatively smooth.
